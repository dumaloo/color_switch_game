# ðŸŽ® Color Switch Clone - Classic Mode ðŸŽ®

Ever wondered how your favorite mobile games are made? Well, I took on the challenge and created my own!

I've successfully created a replica of the classic mode of the game **Color Switch**, a 2D game with several modes, using the **Flame engine** and **Flutter**. This journey wouldn't have been possible without the exceptional tutorial by Iman on YouTube. Huge thanks to [Iman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iman-khoshabi-7782a9114/) for the comprehensive coverage of Flame, which made this success possible! Check out his YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/@imaNNeO).

You can check out the project and even give the APK a try:

But that's not all! I'm currently working on developing another mode of the same game called **Run**. Stay tuned for more updates!
